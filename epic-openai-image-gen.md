## ðŸŽ¯ Epic Overview

### Description
Implement a comprehensive OpenAI image generation tool using the GPT-Image-1 model. This tool will provide a robust interface for generating images through OpenAI's API, with proper error handling, security measures, and performance optimizations.

### Business Value
- Enable AI-powered image generation capabilities
- Provide developers with an easy-to-use interface for image creation
- Support various use cases including content creation, prototyping, and creative workflows
- Demonstrate integration with external AI services

### Objectives
- [x] Define detailed requirements and scope
- [ ] Create architecture/design documentation
- [ ] Break down into manageable subtasks
- [ ] Implement core functionality
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Security review
- [ ] Final review and polish

### Subtasks
- [ ] #TBD - Research OpenAI Image API requirements and limitations
- [ ] #TBD - Design modular architecture for image generator
- [ ] #TBD - Implement core API integration with proper error handling
- [ ] #TBD - Create CLI interface for image generation
- [ ] #TBD - Add configuration management for API keys and settings
- [ ] #TBD - Implement rate limiting and usage tracking
- [ ] #TBD - Add comprehensive test suite
- [ ] #TBD - Create user documentation and examples

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Successfully generates images using GPT-Image-1 model
- [ ] Proper error handling for API failures and rate limits
- [ ] Secure handling of API keys (no hardcoded values)
- [ ] Test coverage > 80%
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (< 5s response time)
- [ ] Documentation complete with examples
- [ ] Security review passed (no API key exposure)
- [ ] Works seamlessly within the ignore folder

### Technical Considerations
- Dependencies: OpenAI SDK, HTTP client, image handling libraries
- Performance requirements: Async operations, connection pooling
- Security considerations: API key management, secure storage, no commits to git
- Breaking changes: None expected
- Location: Must be in /ignore folder to prevent git commits

### Timeline Estimate
- **Start Date**: 2025-07-02
- **Target Completion**: 2025-07-03
- **Estimated Effort**: 2 days / 16 story points

### Progress Tracking
- **Status**: ðŸŸ¢ In Progress
- **Completed Subtasks**: 0/8
- **Blockers**: None

### Notes
- API key is available in .env file as OPENAI_API_KEY
- Implementation must be placed in the /ignore folder
- Ensure no sensitive data is committed to version control
- Consider implementing caching for frequently requested images
- Add support for various image sizes and formats

*This is an epic issue. Please break it down into smaller, actionable tasks before starting implementation. Each subtask should be completable within 1-2 days.*

**For Swarms**: To claim this epic, first break it down into subtasks, then claim individual subtasks rather than the entire epic.
