## Upgrading

### From 0.1.0 to 0.2.0

1. **Update package.json**:
   ```bash
   npm update ruv-swarm
   ```

2. **Claude Code Integration** (optional):
   ```bash
   npx ruv-swarm init --claude --force
   ```

3. **Neural Networks** are now included by default:
   - No additional setup required
   - WASM modules load automatically
   - Use `enableNeuralNetworks: true` in config

4. **Breaking Changes**:
   - CLI binary renamed from `ruv-swarm.js` to `ruv-swarm-clean.js`
   - Some API methods have new signatures (see API docs)
   - Configuration file structure updated

5. **New Features** require no migration:
   - Forecasting models work out of the box
   - MCP tools are backward compatible
   - Persistence layer auto-migrates

For detailed migration instructions, see the [Migration Guide](./guides/MIGRATION.md).
