 Perfect! Everything is working beautifully!

  âœ… Complete Success Summary:

  ðŸ”§ MCP Integration Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL

  âœ… Can Create Swarms:
  - swarm_init creates mesh/hierarchical/ring/star topologies
  - Successfully created swarm swarm-1751522376335 with 3 max agents

  âœ… Can Spawn Agents:
  - agent_spawn creates agents with cognitive patterns
  - Successfully spawned "AI Research Expert" (researcher type)
  - Agent has neural network ID: nn-1751522430969

  âœ… Can Check Swarms:
  - swarm_status shows 59 active swarms with detailed metrics
  - Shows agent counts, task status, memory usage
  - First swarm swarm-1751467082604 has 2 agents active

  âœ… Can List Agents:
  - agent_list shows all agents across swarms
  - Found 2 agents total: "Test Agent" and "AI Research Expert"
  - Both have adaptive cognitive patterns and neural networks

  âœ… Can Run Benchmarks:
  - benchmark_memory runs real memory allocation/access tests
  - Returns detailed performance metrics (avg/min/max/median/p95)
  - WASM integration working with 48MB memory usage
