## ðŸŽ¯ Epic Overview

### Description
Create a comprehensive Sli.dev presentation that explains how to use ruv-swarm and how it works internally. This slideshow will serve as both a tutorial and technical documentation, providing users with a clear understanding of ruv-swarm's capabilities, architecture, and best practices.

### Business Value
- Provide clear, visual documentation for ruv-swarm users
- Reduce onboarding time for new developers
- Showcase ruv-swarm's features and capabilities
- Create reusable presentation material for demos and training
- Improve adoption through better understanding

### Objectives

- [ ] Create presentation outline and structure
- [ ] Design visual assets and diagrams
- [ ] Implement core slides with content
- [ ] Add interactive code examples
- [ ] Include live demos and examples
- [ ] Create speaker notes
- [ ] Review and polish presentation
- [ ] Deploy to GitHub Pages

### Subtasks
- [ ] #TBD - Research and install Sli.dev framework

*This is an epic issue. Please break it down into smaller, actionable tasks before starting implementation. Each subtask should be completable within 1-2 days.*

**For Swarms**: To claim this epic, first break it down into subtasks, then claim individual subtasks rather than the entire epic.
