# ✅ GitHub Swarm Coordination Setup Complete

The GitHub swarm coordination system has been successfully set up for the ruv-swarm-cli project.

## What Was Created

### 1. Configuration Files
- **`.env.example`** - Template for environment variables
- **`.env`** - Your configured environment (swarm ID: swarm-jed)

### 2. Helper Scripts
- **`scripts/swarm-helper.sh`** - Main coordination tool with commands:
  - `status` - Show your swarm status
  - `tasks` - List available tasks
  - `claim` - Claim an issue
  - `update` - Post progress updates
  - `complete` - Mark task complete
  - `release` - Release a claim
  - `sync` - Sync with GitHub
  - `conflicts` - Check for conflicts

- **`scripts/setup-aliases.sh`** - Quick command aliases

### 3. Documentation
- **`GITHUB_SWARM_SETUP.md`** - Quick start guide
- **`SETUP_COMPLETE.md`** - This file

## Current Status

✅ Scripts created and configured
✅ Environment variables set up (swarm ID: swarm-jed)
✅ Error handling implemented
❌ GitHub CLI not installed (required for operation)

## Next Steps

### 1. Install GitHub CLI
The scripts require GitHub CLI to interact with GitHub issues. Install it:

```bash
# macOS
brew install gh

# Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt install gh

# Other Linux
# Visit: https://github.com/cli/cli#installation
```

### 2. Authenticate GitHub CLI
```bash
gh auth login
```

### 3. Load Aliases (Optional)
```bash
source scripts/setup-aliases.sh
```

### 4. Test Your Setup
```bash
# Using the helper script directly
./scripts/swarm-helper.sh status

# Or with aliases (after sourcing)
swarm-status
```

## Quick Command Reference

```bash
# Find work
swarm-tasks           # All available tasks
tasks-high           # High priority only

# Work on issues
swarm-claim 123      # Claim issue #123
swarm-update 123 "Progress message"
swarm-complete 123   # Mark as done

# Check status
swarm-status         # Your active work
swarm-conflicts      # Potential conflicts
```

## How It Works

1. **Task Discovery**: Browse available GitHub issues labeled "available"
2. **Claim Work**: Add "swarm-claimed" label and comment with your swarm ID
3. **Track Progress**: Post updates as comments
4. **Complete/Release**: Remove claim when done or blocked

The system prevents conflicts by tracking which swarm is working on each issue through labels and comments containing swarm IDs.

## Troubleshooting

- **"gh: command not found"** - Install GitHub CLI (see above)
- **"Not authenticated"** - Run `gh auth login`
- **Can't see issues** - Check repository access permissions

## Integration with ruv-swarm MCP

This GitHub coordination complements the ruv-swarm MCP tools:
- GitHub handles task assignment and tracking
- ruv-swarm MCP provides AI agent coordination
- Use both together for maximum efficiency
