## Versioning Strategy

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

This project follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** version (X.y.z): Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version (x.Y.z): New functionality, backwards compatible
- **PATCH** version (x.y.Z): Bug fixes, backwards compatible

### Version Categories

#### 0.x.y - Development Releases
- Pre-1.0 releases indicate development/experimental status
- Breaking changes allowed between minor versions
- Current target: `0.1.0` (initial release)

#### 1.x.y - Stable Releases
- API stability guaranteed within major version
- Deprecation warnings before breaking changes
- Minimum 3-month notice for major version changes

### Release Types

#### Alpha (0.1.0-alpha.x)
- Internal testing only
- Major features incomplete
- API subject to change

#### Beta (0.1.0-beta.x)
- Feature complete for release
- API mostly stable
- Community testing encouraged

#### Release Candidate (0.1.0-rc.x)
- Production-ready candidate
- Only critical bug fixes
- Final API freeze

#### Stable (0.1.0)
- Production ready
- Full feature set
- Comprehensive testing completed

## Current Release Plan

**Estimated Timeline**: 3-4 months after beta

## Release Process

### 1. Pre-Release
```bash
# Update version in Cargo.toml
# Update CHANGELOG.md
# Run full test suite
cargo test --all-features
cargo check --all-targets --all-features
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

# Security audit
cargo audit

# Build documentation
cargo doc --all-features --no-deps
```

### 2. Package Creation
```bash
# Create package
cargo package

# Verify package contents
cargo package --list

# Test package installation
cargo install --path . --force
```

### 3. Publishing
```bash
# Dry run
cargo publish --dry-run

# Actual publish (after manual verification)
cargo publish
```

### 4. Post-Release
```bash
# Tag release
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0

# Update documentation
# Announce release
# Monitor for issues
```

## Quality Gates

### Mandatory Checks
- [ ] Compilation successful on all supported platforms
- [ ] Test coverage > 80%
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Performance benchmarks within acceptable ranges

### Recommended Checks
- [ ] Code review by at least 2 developers
- [ ] Integration testing in real scenarios
- [ ] Performance profiling completed
- [ ] Memory usage analysis
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility verified

## Post-1.0 Strategy

### Stability Promise
- Semantic versioning strictly followed
- Deprecation policy with migration guides
- LTS (Long Term Support) versions every 18 months
- Security patches for at least 2 major versions

### Feature Development
- Feature flags for experimental functionality
- Alpha/beta channels for early adopters
- Community RFC process for major changes
- Regular release cadence (quarterly minor releases)

## Rollback Plan

### Critical Issues
If critical issues are discovered post-release:
1. Immediate `cargo yank` of problematic version
2. Hotfix release within 24-48 hours
3. Communication to users via GitHub issues/discussions
4. Post-mortem analysis and process improvements

### Yanking Policy
Versions will be yanked only for:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data corruption bugs
- Compilation failures on supported platforms
- Legal/licensing issues

## Notes

**Current Status**: The crate is not yet ready for publication due to compilation errors. Focus should be on resolving these issues before attempting to publish.

**Key Blockers**:
1. Missing dependency implementations
2. Module structure inconsistencies  
3. Type definition conflicts
4. Import path issues

**Next Steps**:
1. Systematic resolution of compilation errors
2. Implementation of missing core traits
3. Restructuring of module organization
4. Comprehensive testing of basic functionality
