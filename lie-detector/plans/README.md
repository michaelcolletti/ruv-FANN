# Veritas Nexus Implementation Plans

This directory contains the comprehensive implementation plans for the **Veritas Nexus** multi-modal lie detection system built on the ruv-FANN neural network foundation.

## Plan Documents

### 1. [Veritas Nexus Implementation Plan](veritas-nexus-implementation-plan.md)
The complete integrated implementation plan combining architecture, technical specifications, and MCP interface design.

### 2. [Architecture Design](veritas-core-architecture.md)
Detailed system architecture including:
- Module organization
- Core trait definitions
- ruv-FANN integration patterns
- Multi-modal data flow
- ReAct agent design
- Error handling hierarchy

### 3. [Technical Specification](veritas-core-technical-specification.md)
Performance-focused technical details:
- CPU optimization strategies (SIMD, cache optimization)
- GPU acceleration with candle-core
- Memory management and pooling
- Streaming pipeline architecture
- Comprehensive benchmarking suite

### 4. [MCP Interface Specification](mcp-interface-specification.md)
Complete MCP server design using official Rust SDK:
- Tool definitions for model management
- Resource providers for data access
- Real-time event streaming
- Security and authentication
- CLI integration

## Quick Overview

**Crate Name:** `veritas-nexus`

**Key Technologies:**
- ruv-FANN for neural network foundation
- Multi-modal analysis (vision, audio, text, physiological)
- ReAct reasoning framework for explainability
- GSPO for self-improving models
- MCP for management interface
- CPU/GPU optimization for blazing performance

**Development Timeline:** 24 weeks divided into 6 phases

**Target Performance:**
- Single frame analysis: < 10ms (P95)
- Batch processing: > 100 FPS
- Memory usage: < 500MB peak
- Model load time: < 100ms

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve the implementation plans
2. Set up the project repository and CI/CD
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation (core infrastructure)
4. Establish testing and benchmarking frameworks
5. Create initial documentation and examples
