- Various age groups and life experiences

**Ongoing Data Management:**
- Regular audits of training data
- Continuous data collection from underrepresented groups
- Feedback-driven dataset improvements
- Third-party validation of data quality

### 2. **Algorithmic Fairness Testing**

**Pre-Deployment Testing:**
```rust
// Example bias testing framework
use veritas_nexus::bias::*;

async fn test_demographic_fairness() -> Result<FairnessReport> {
    let detector = LieDetector::new().await?;
    let test_data = load_diverse_test_dataset().await?;
    
    let fairness_tester = FairnessTester::new()
        .with_protected_attributes(&["race", "gender", "age"])
        .with_fairness_metrics(&[
            FairnessMetric::EqualOpportunity,
            FairnessMetric::DemographicParity,
            FairnessMetric::CalibrationEquity,
        ]);
    
    let report = fairness_tester
        .evaluate(&detector, &test_data)
        .await?;
    
    assert!(report.all_metrics_pass(), "Fairness requirements not met");
    Ok(report)
}
```

**Continuous Monitoring:**
```rust
// Example production monitoring
use veritas_nexus::monitoring::*;

let bias_monitor = BiasMonitor::new()
    .with_alert_threshold(0.05) // 5% difference threshold
    .with_protected_groups(&["racial_groups", "gender_groups"])
    .with_monitoring_interval(Duration::from_hours(24));

tokio::spawn(async move {
    while let Some(alert) = bias_monitor.next_alert().await {
        eprintln!("Bias alert: {:?}", alert);
        // Trigger review process
        initiate_bias_review(alert).await;
    }
});
```

### 3. **Fairness-Aware Model Design**

**Multi-Task Learning:**
- Train models to be accurate across all groups
- Use adversarial training to reduce bias
